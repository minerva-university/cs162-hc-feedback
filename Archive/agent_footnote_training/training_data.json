You have an ambitious 5-year plan to raise money and quickly scale to hundreds of employees. Part of your planning is to ensure that your nonprofit is a great place to work, so you investigate companies that seem to be doing a good job with that.In a2021 surveyof 70,000 companies in the USA, the happiest employees were at Adobe. In aninterviewabout ranking #1, you learn that Adobe identified employee preferences and ideas through surveys, meetings, and focus groups, and then (1) added days each month when the entire company had days off, (2) added community-building events, including an annual diversity and inclusion event, (3) allowed each employee to take an additional 20 days off of their choice each year, (4) allowed employees to have more flexibility in their work schedules, especially in recognition of family responsibilities, and (5) reimbursed an additional $600 per year for expenses related to health and wellness.You think about how these items worked on many levels and interacted with each other. The most important to you seem to be the community level of the company as a whole, each worker\u2019s friend or family circle, and finally, each worker. You identify how crucial a healthy working environment is for a person\u2019s overall mood based on a psychological study that you read and how feeling good after a day at work may make a person more receptive to the moods and feelings of their closest people. You clearly outlined the mechanism through which less stressful working environments are likely to influence healthy family dynamics significantly. On the other hand, you analyzed how spending more time with family and friends makes a person more well-rested (individual level) and boosts their working creativity, which improves the company\u2019s productivity overall (working community level) by providing additional examples of effective companies based on employees self-reported satisfaction with their family situation.As your startup grew, you learned how Adobe got to #1 on employee satisfaction. In an interview, you discovered Adobe\u2019s enthusiasm for community-building events and wondered how creating a shared sense of togetherness at a group level depended on each person (individual-level) showing up happy and well-rested (biological level).",

First you analyze how the community building events have a beneficial effect on the employees\u2019 attitude towards the work process and how that attitude is transferred to their personal lives. Then you look at how the extra time they dedicate to their personal lives contributes to their work performance. Finally, you identify how both of those levels impact each other through the level of the individual and how the individual\u2019s perception of their situation might influence their work and family life"

You decide you have three realistic #shapingbehavior options to alter smoking behavior. You could increase the city tax on cigarettes $1 which reduces the utility of purchasing cigarettes by forcing smokers to forego the utility they could gain by spending the dollar they lose to tax (a disincentive). Alternatively, you could run an informational ad campaign that educates the public on the dangers of secondhand smoke. You hope the campaign would result in smokers facing social pressure not to smoke after they light up and that the social pressure will slowly condition smokers to change their preference for smoking over time (a social punishment that discourages the behavior). And finally, you consider passing a law that forbids cigarette vendors from displaying cigarette packs behind registers. Note that this law does not limit the ability of customers to purchase cigarettes, but makes the presence of cigarettes less salient when customers are making a purchasing decision (choice architecture). Weighing the costs and benefits of each approach, and considering the constraint that you can only choose one, you decide the tax is the best choice.",

You are contemplating how to create this diagram. You first choose to represent the organization by separating it into different departments because the employees within each work together closely, and therefore are expected to share some norms and views about the organizations. While this decomposition reveals the dynamics of interactions between large groups such as the lack of communication between the medical staff in different departments or between the medical and cleaning staff, there are no obvious inefficiencies. You then decide to deconstruct the system by focusing on the roles of individuals and find that each department has its own educational campaigning function and that there is little communication between those working on educational campaigns in different departments. It turns out that there is a large amount of money being spent on educational campaigns overall. This was not obvious when the system was deconstructed by department because education campaigns are funded by each department separately, at relatively low cost. You advise making educational campaigns a central process, consolidating common costs and being able to prioritize what should be budgeted.",

To understand the problem and find possible solutions, the system was deconstructed in several ways and the chosen deconstruction is the one that addresses the explanatory challenge.

You realize you need to first understand what causes homelessness in order to approach ending it. You identify three main causes: drug addiction, mental health issues, and lack of access to financial opportunities. You consider how these might interact and perhaps lead to or reinforce one another. Drugs may worsen, or cause, mental illness. These, in turn, can cause financial challenges. However, drugs can also be the direct cause of financial struggles, even if mental illness is not involved. You realize there is no single necessary cause for homelessness you could target, but rather a number of separate causes (some of which may be on their own sufficient, or more realistically make it very likely one would end up homeless). This means the best way to approach the problem would be to evaluate these causes and find the ones that most bear on homelessness. You realize that because drugs and mental health issues can cause financial struggles to a larger extent than the opposite, it might be more useful to start by tackling them first. Tackling financial struggles would require you to also tackle drugs and mental health issues since they are higher-order causes. You therefore propose to the city government to start drug addiction recovery services for the homeless, hoping that this would improve the mental health and financial conditions of the homeless.",

Your victory is due mostly to the unpopularity of the previous mayor you ran against: she had a record of many failed interventions to revitalize the town, including a recent high-profile disaster in which the town put every effort into recruiting a regional company to move their headquarters to Lakeville, only to see the headquarters set up in the nearby town of Oceanview.

In contrast, Lakeville\u2019s Main Street has many empty storefronts and a high homeless population, and no new businesses want to move to the town. You convene a diverse panel of experts, including economists, social workers, business leaders, and community activists. You realize a historian will also help, to think about how other towns have floundered or flourished in the past. Finally, you and your team produce a phase space that suggests the easiest place to intervene on the system: the town should stop trying to recruit businesses, and instead spend its small budget to hire local unemployed citizens to improve the town\u2019s infrastructure and general beautification. Some people are even hired to help build houses that they then live in. Having moved up sufficiently on \u201cpersonal and professional opportunities for citizens\u201d the town then starts attracting large businesses, and is soon past the critical point that will lead it to \u201ceconomic flourishing.\u201d",

The city officials don\u2019t agree to outsource the cement work to the offshore contractor, because they want local employment. They also disagree on your choice of heavy machinery supplier because they believe you can find cheaper options locally. You consider your alternatives to a negotiated agreement in each dimension, and are willing to concede the offshore contractor because the company they prefer has comparable pricing and quality, but you know that only this specific machinery supplier has exactly what you need. You remind them that for the factory to succeed, you need the material from this particular supplier. You then remind them that it is in both of their interests to use quality material from the start, because not only will the factory\u2019s presence inject capital into the local economy, but it will also avoid having construction issues and expenses that both parties would have to deal with down the line. You also keep in mind that if this agreement doesn\u2019t work, you could always build the factory in a nearby town which would be a little less ideal but would fit your constraints, and the city government would incur a loss of employment as well as capital from the factory\u2019s success. This alternative would be less ideal logistically but would be a larger financial loss for the city officials than you. This gives you the confidence to negotiate for the heavy machinery supplier to maximize gains in the negotiated agreement.

Your company\u2019s most successful game is a puzzle-like competitive murder mystery game called WhoSolvedItFirst that has hundreds of people try to solve a puzzle mystery in real time before others do. Recently the game went viral following a clip of a TikTok influencer and everyone has been working nights to keep up with the demand. The CEO has called a meeting to brainstorm ways to reduce workload while maintaining the success. The main goal is to monetize the game in a sustainable way. In the meeting, you\u2019re very impressed with the creative ideas presented. When it\u2019s your turn, near the end, you suddenly ask everyone - does it matter that our users are mostly 11-13 years old? Like many other plans, yours relies heavily on many microtransactions (many opportunities for buying in-game features for small amounts of money) and that now makes you uneasy. Your question stirred a lively discussion as some say children users require special protections while others said that microtransactions are manipulative even when users are adults. The CEO says that a core value of the company is to make products that celebrate joy and creativity rather than addiction and frustration, and tasks you to research the ethical considerations of microtransactions. In the memo you\u2019re preparing for the CEO, you consider the different issues with microtransactions in general and those that are specific to children users. In general, microtransactions are accused of being manipulative - they \u2018trick\u2019 people into buying things they wouldn\u2019t want or didn\u2019t really agree to. You summarize research on the psychology of impulse purchasing and the design tricks of deception called \u2018dark patterns.\u2019 You conclude that a key value is informed consent and that the company needs to decide what exactly that means. Turning to the issue of children, you find that children are particularly vulnerable to manipulations as well as claims that children under a certain age cannot at all give informed consent because their brain hasn\u2019t yet fully developed. Relatedly, you find a host of issues relating to parental control. Some apps rely on features offered by the mobile device while others involve parents' permission directly. Summarizing this section of your memo you conclude that the key question is whether, and to what extent, kids\u2019 consent is limited in its reach and specifically, what role should parents/guardians be required to play in the process of getting children\u2019s consent.",

A week after you settle in the res hall, you have 15 new apps on your phone. About half of them are ones you\u2019ve never heard of before. One of these apps allows students in your class to post anonymous messages about whatever they want. It is supposed to be a space to ask questions and get help about mental health issues, but you quickly learn that it\u2019s where many rumors are circulated, including personal information (like who is dating who). You find it a little troubling at first, but it really starts to bother you when one student becomes a frequent target for nasty messages. She is a quiet student who doesn\u2019t engage much socially and speaks very slowly. You start hearing impatient sighs when she is called on to talk in class and it makes you feel very uncomfortable. When she incidentally appears in a Minerva Quest vlog for a few seconds, someone posts an edited version of it to the anonymous app, slowing it down to make her sound ridiculous. A string of memes then follows with other students reposting the clip with a variety of cheap photoshopped modifications that receive lots of emoji responses. Someone then writes\u2026 \u201cyou all are just assuming that she isn\u2019t on this app\u2026 but maybe it\u2019s better if she is lol.\u201dAfter that, you can\u2019t take it anymore and decide you\u2019re going to respond. You hate doing this because you already have a reputation as a party pooper for complaining about noise in the study room during quiet hours. You decide you\u2019ll just have to live with it and find friends among people who really know you. You write a long message in the anonymous app and reveal your identity. You say it\u2019s not cool to make fun of someone like that and that it\u2019s not the purpose of the app. No one responds to your message, except for thumbs-up emojis, but the activity there dies out completely. You also note that people are much more careful about reacting in class when the targeted student is talking. To your face, people only express support for your post, but you also find that you aren\u2019t invited to many social events and it becomes harder to make new friends. This feels bad but you also know that this attitude will pass, and that in time, you\u2019ll find the right people for you. Plus, you\u2019re happy that the bullying stopped, at least in public.",

No one else spoke up and many people participated in the bullying so the individual knew that saying something would not be seen well by many students.

The suspect has shared videos where he threatens that other attacks are forthcoming. The government has asked the company that sells the phone and laptop to find a way to break into the phone. Still, the company is hesitant because it prides itself on prioritizing the security and privacy of its customers.On reflection, you decide to defend the position that the company should comply with the government\u2019s demands, and you draw from ethical theoretical resources to support your argument. You choose to adopt the perspective of a utilitarian, who aims to produce the greatest good for the greatest number. As a consequentialist, utilitarians would argue that the ends justify the means, and that if we have good reason to believe that violations of this one person\u2019s right to privacy could prevent catastrophic loss of life, then there would be strong ethical reasons to support policies or laws that enable a company to coordinate efforts with the government.You then pit two interpretations of utilitarianism against each other to test your argument. Utilitarians care about both long-term and short-term utility, so you develop a counterargument from another broadly utilitarian perspective that concludes the opposite \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t override personal privacy rights in this case because doing so catalyzes long-term and far-reaching opportunities for governments to claim exceptions to rules of protection for consumer privacy. Releasing private data could erode public trust and confidence in the independence of businesses from government monitoring.Then you respond to this counterargument. While there are risks in taking either approach, you reason that this is an exceptional case because of the credible and catastrophic threat to life and property this person poses. You suggest that in such a case, a company should adopt a narrowly defined exception to its privacy clause and retain judgment in future cases, which it would evaluate individually. You conclude that the company should comply with the government\u2019s demands in this case.",

These limits are separated by two orders of magnitude, so you take the approximate geometric mean of these bounds. The mean of the coefficients of each limit\u2019s scientific notation is 3.5 and their average power is 2.5. So, you round the power of 10 down to 2 and multiply the coefficient by 3. Finally, you get a grand total of 1,050 hotels in LA. After a quick Google search, you find out the reported number is 1,008. Not bad!",
      "footnote": "To arrive at a quantity of interest, related figures which are easier to estimate are used progressively, from the number of rooms and the guests they house to the total number of guests in the city. This last figure comes from a potentially problematic assumption, that the number of hotel guests is proportional to LA\u2019s population, but the final estimate is plausible nonetheless."

Recognizing this as an inductive generalization, I knew it would be most productive to assess its strength and reliability, so I tried to help Kate question the degree to which her conclusion is supported. First of all, the argument is not very strong since Kate only based her conclusion on two people she knows and then generalized to a large population of people. Kate can increase the strength of the argument by providing more premises to support the conclusion. She can do that by including a variety of evidence from quality sources, like surveys that have found that a majority of Kpop fans like boba or sources that provide plausible reasons/explanations for a relationship between adoration of Kpop and boba. Ensuring these premises directly support the conclusion would make her argument stronger, but it would only be consideredif the pieces of evidence are actually true (e.g., from trustworthy sources) rather than just fabricated claims.\u00a0 She can also strengthen the argument by making the conclusion less hasty, e.g, by saying that Most Kpop fans like bubble tea rather than all.Footnote:his application classifies Kate\u2019s reasoning as induction by generalization.

You use a range of data collecting techniques, including interviews, behavioral observations, and fMRI brain scans to explore why he might exhibit such a notoriously high level of happiness. For a second case study, you choose a city in Denmark that is known for its happy citizens. You investigate a range of things about the city that might explain the happiness of its residents, such as municipal policies related to quality-of-life and the economic prosperity of the city. Both case studies reveal useful findings, but you are uncertain to what extent the findings can be generalized. You thus decide to test the hypotheses generated by your two case studies using methods from #observationalstudy, such as a prospective cohort study to corroborate how generalizable the findings are.",

Your hypothesis is that administering three different antibiotics simultaneously is more effective than administering the same three antibiotics cyclically (one after the other), which in turn is more effective than administering only your strongest antibiotic. To address this hypothesis, you consider enlisting the help of hospitals and having doctors prescribe one of the three methods you are investigating to patients. You consider that there are two important issues with this experiment design: first, since you already have good indication that simultaneous antibiotic delivery is much better for preventing bacterial resistance, it would be unethical to deny people the best treatment. Second, it would be very hard to control relevant variables like type of bacteria, location of infection, method of antibiotic application, and others. Whereas you recognize that testing antibiotics on humans will have to be done eventually, for now you decide to run lab-based experiments on bacterial cultures, using three different antibiotics. You decide to have three intervention groups: one in which bacteria are attacked only with your strongest antibiotic during 30 days, one in which bacteria are attacked with three antibiotics for 10 days each, and one in which bacteria are attacked throughout the 30 days with all 3 antibiotics simultaneously. To account for the possibility that the injection of liquid into a bacterial culture has an effect on bacterial survival, you add a \u201cplacebo\u201d group to the experiment, wherein a harmless liquid will be applied to bacteria. Furthermore, you add a \u201cnatural history\u201d group of bacteria who will suffer no treatment to serve as a comparison, a baseline against the placebo and intervention groups. Finally, you are sure to control for variables like availability of sustenance, incidence of sunlight, temperature, moisture, and chemicals the bacteria are exposed to. You keep your four bacteria groups inside a sterilized lab, in petri dishes, to control for these variables. Because of the tightly controlled design of your experiment, you recognize that there may be some issues with generalizability of your results. You also consider that bacteria inhabiting living beings may react very differently to treatment, and so you suggest that, for a future experiment, you should try to kill bacteria infecting mice rather than \u201cinfecting\u201d petri dishes.

You conclude that these are not necessarily contradictory, because they are not exact replications of each other.
