       "Let's evaluate the thesis statement:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Thesis Statement:** Investing in homeless shelters is merely a temporary relief to homelessness in San Francisco because doing so fails to address underlying causes in terms of housing unaffordability, low wages, and rising inflation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Evaluation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Substantial, Precise, Relevant, Arguable, Concise, and Sets up Forthcoming Evidence:**  The thesis is substantial in that it tackles a significant issue. It's precise by focusing on San Francisco and specifying the inadequacy of shelters. It's relevant to the topic of homelessness.  It's arguable because it presents a position that requires supporting evidence (that shelters are insufficient and underlying causes need addressing). It's concise, fitting within a single sentence.  It effectively sets up the evidence needed:  the thesis points toward evidence demonstrating the limitations of shelters and the importance of addressing housing affordability, low wages, and inflation.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Appropriate Scope:** The scope is appropriate for an undergraduate journal article. It's focused enough to be manageable within the constraints of a typical undergraduate paper but significant enough to be worthwhile.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Supported by Evidence of Your Work:** This is crucial. The thesis statement *itself* doesn't prove anything. Its strength depends entirely on whether the body of the article provides sufficient evidence to support the claim that shelters offer only temporary relief and that addressing housing affordability, low wages, and inflation is necessary for a lasting solution.  The statement needs to be backed up by data on shelter usage, housing costs, wage statistics, inflation rates in San Francisco, and perhaps case studies of individuals experiencing homelessness.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **References to Evidence Type:** The thesis statement doesn't explicitly mention the *type* of evidence.  Improving it would involve hinting at the kinds of data or analysis that will be presented.  For example:  \"Investing in homeless shelters is merely a temporary relief to homelessness in San Francisco because doing so fails to address underlying causes, as evidenced by statistical analysis of shelter re-entry rates, alongside data on housing costs, wage stagnation, and inflation rates in the city.\"  This improved version gives the reader a clearer idea of the methodology and type of evidence to expect.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **One to Two Sentence Statement:** The thesis is a single, well-constructed sentence.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Overall:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The thesis statement is good, but it could be strengthened by explicitly referencing the *types* of evidence that will be used to support the claim.  Adding a brief indication of the types of data analysis enhances its clarity and persuasiveness.  The success of this thesis hinges entirely on the quality and quantity of the evidence presented in the body of the paper.\n"

       "The thesis statement is effective but could be improved by specifying the types of evidence to be used.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Criteria Check\n",
       "1. Core Requirements (substantial/precise/relevant/arguable/concise): Pass.  The thesis is substantial enough to support an undergraduate-level article. It's precise in its focus on investing in shelters and their limited impact.  It's relevant to the problem of homelessness in San Francisco. It's arguable because it presents a specific, counter-intuitive claim (shelters are only temporary relief).  It's concise and clearly stated.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Scope: Pass. The scope is appropriate for an undergraduate article. It focuses on a specific aspect of the complex homelessness issue in San Francisco.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Evidence Support: Pass.  The thesis implicitly indicates that it will be supported by evidence related to housing unaffordability, low wages, and rising inflation.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Evidence Types: Fail. While the thesis mentions the *areas* of evidence, it doesn't specify the *types* of evidence (e.g., statistical data on housing costs, wage data, inflation rates, case studies of individuals experiencing homelessness, interviews with service providers). This needs improvement.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Length & Focus: Pass. The thesis statement is within the 1-2 sentence limit and maintains a clear focus.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Pitfall Analysis\n",
       "* **Missing importance context:** While the thesis mentions the city, a brief reference to the scale of the problem in San Francisco (e.g., \"the significant and growing number of homeless individuals\") could strengthen the introduction and provide further context for the argument.\n",
       "* **Stating claim without reasoning (although minimal):** While the thesis presents the main argument, a very brief elaboration on *why* addressing underlying causes is crucial might improve the impact.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### Action Items\n",
       "1. **Specify evidence types:**  Revise the thesis to include specific examples of the evidence that will be used to support each of the three underlying causes (housing unaffordability, low wages, and rising inflation).  For example:  \"Investing in homeless shelters is merely a temporary relief to homelessness in San Francisco because doing so fails to address underlying causes such as unaffordability demonstrated by [type of data, e.g.,  rising rental costs and lack of affordable housing units], low wages reflected in [type of data, e.g.,  the stagnant minimum wage and prevalence of low-paying jobs], and rising inflation impacting [type of data, e.g., the cost of basic necessities].\"\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Strengthen contextualization:** Add a brief phrase at the beginning to highlight the scale of the problem to further underscore the significance of the argument. For example: \"Given the significant and growing number of homeless individuals in San Francisco, investing in homeless shelters...\"\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Briefly elaborate on the 'why':** Consider adding a short phrase explaining the connection between addressing the root causes and achieving long-term solutions. For example: \"...because solely focusing on shelter provision neglects the systemic issues driving homelessness, ultimately hindering the creation of sustainable solutions.\"\n"
