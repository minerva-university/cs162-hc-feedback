You have an ambitious 5-year plan to raise money and quickly scale to hundreds of employees. Part of your planning is to ensure that your nonprofit is a great place to work, so you investigate companies that seem to be doing a good job with that.In a2021 surveyof 70,000 companies in the USA, the happiest employees were at Adobe. In aninterviewabout ranking #1, you learn that Adobe identified employee preferences and ideas through surveys, meetings, and focus groups, and then (1) added days each month when the entire company had days off, (2) added community-building events, including an annual diversity and inclusion event, (3) allowed each employee to take an additional 20 days off of their choice each year, (4) allowed employees to have more flexibility in their work schedules, especially in recognition of family responsibilities, and (5) reimbursed an additional $600 per year for expenses related to health and wellness.You think about how these items worked on many levels and interacted with each other. The most important to you seem to be the community level of the company as a whole, each worker's friend or family circle, and finally, each worker. You identify how crucial a healthy working environment is for a person's overall mood based on a psychological study that you read and how feeling good after a day at work may make a person more receptive to the moods and feelings of their closest people. You clearly outlined the mechanism through which less stressful working environments are likely to influence healthy family dynamics significantly. On the other hand, you analyzed how spending more time with family and friends makes a person more well-rested (individual level) and boosts their working creativity, which improves the company's productivity overall (working community level) by providing additional examples of effective companies based on employees self-reported satisfaction with their family situation.As your startup grew, you learned how Adobe got to #1 on employee satisfaction. In an interview, you discovered Adobe's enthusiasm for community-building events and wondered how creating a shared sense of togetherness at a group level depended on each person (individual-level) showing up happy and well-rested (biological level).Footnote:In your attempt to understand the phenomenon for Adobe's success you consider the individual employees' lives at multiple levels and how those might interact to support the company's productivity. First you analyze how the community building events have a beneficial effect on the employees' attitude towards the work process and how that attitude is transferred to their personal lives. Then you look at how the extra time they dedicate to their personal lives contributes to their work performance. Finally, you identify how both of those levels impact each other through the level of the individual and how the individual's perception of their situation might influence their work and family life",

Alternatively, you could run an informational ad campaign that educates the public on the dangers of secondhand smoke. You hope the campaign would result in smokers facing social pressure not to smoke after they light up and that the social pressure will slowly condition smokers to change their preference for smoking over time (a social punishment that discourages the behavior). And finally, you consider passing a law that forbids cigarette vendors from displaying cigarette packs behind registers. Note that this law does not limit the ability of customers to purchase cigarettes, but makes the presence of cigarettes less salient when customers are making a purchasing decision (choice architecture). Weighing the costs and benefits of each approach, and considering the constraint that you can only choose one, you decide the tax is the best choice.Footnote:Three separate approaches that would plausibly alter behavior in the desired way are presented and the underlying mechanisms that explain how each approach might shape behavior are explained.

While this decomposition reveals the dynamics of interactions between large groups such as the lack of communication between the medical staff in different departments or between the medical and cleaning staff, there are no obvious inefficiencies. You then decide to deconstruct the system by focusing on the roles of individuals and find that each department has its own educational campaigning function and that there is little communication between those working on educational campaigns in different departments. It turns out that there is a large amount of money being spent on educational campaigns overall. This was not obvious when the system was deconstructed by department because education campaigns are funded by each department separately, at relatively low cost. You advise making educational campaigns a central process, consolidating common costs and being able to prioritize what should be budgeted.Footnote:The explanatory challenge was identified: reduce spending.

You identify three main causes: drug addiction, mental health issues, and lack of access to financial opportunities. You consider how these might interact and perhaps lead to or reinforce one another. Drugs may worsen, or cause, mental illness. These, in turn, can cause financial challenges. However, drugs can also be the direct cause of financial struggles, even if mental illness is not involved. You realize there is no single necessary cause for homelessness you could target, but rather a number of separate causes (some of which may be on their own sufficient, or more realistically make it very likely one would end up homeless). This means the best way to approach the problem would be to evaluate these causes and find the ones that most bear on homelessness. You realize that because drugs and mental health issues can cause financial struggles to a larger extent than the opposite, it might be more useful to start by tackling them first. Tackling financial struggles would require you to also tackle drugs and mental health issues since they are higher-order causes. You therefore propose to the city government to start drug addiction recovery services for the homeless, hoping that this would improve the mental health and financial conditions of the homeless.Footnote:Several causes are identified as necessary or sufficient, utilizing this classification to guide the analysis.

Determined to do better than your predecessor, you realize that important features of many towns can be described by a 2-dimensional phase space representing “personal and professional opportunities for citizens” and “attractiveness to large businesses.” Lakeville is stuck in the problematic bottom-left corner of the phase space that you label “economic floundering,” whereas towns like Oceanview are secure in the opposite upper-right corner you label “economic flourishing.” You recognize feedback loops that support Oceanview's economic flourishing, such as how the presence of many businesses provides employment for citizens, leading to a bustling Main Street; the high quality of life is then attractive to further businesses, closing the loop. In contrast, Lakeville's Main Street has many empty storefronts and a high homeless population, and no new businesses want to move to the town. You convene a diverse panel of experts, including economists, social workers, business leaders, and community activists.

You consider your alternatives to a negotiated agreement in each dimension, and are willing to concede the offshore contractor because the company they prefer has comparable pricing and quality, but you know that only this specific machinery supplier has exactly what you need. You remind them that for the factory to succeed, you need the material from this particular supplier. You then remind them that it is in both of their interests to use quality material from the start, because not only will the factory's presence inject capital into the local economy, but it will also avoid having construction issues and expenses that both parties would have to deal with down the line. You also keep in mind that if this agreement doesn't work, you could always build the factory in a nearby town which would be a little less ideal but would fit your constraints, and the city government would incur a loss of employment as well as capital from the factory's success. This alternative would be less ideal logistically but would be a larger financial loss for the city officials than you.

Your company's most successful game is a puzzle-like competitive murder mystery game called WhoSolvedItFirst that has hundreds of people try to solve a puzzle mystery in real time before others do. Recently the game went viral following a clip of a TikTok influencer and everyone has been working nights to keep up with the demand. The CEO has called a meeting to brainstorm ways to reduce workload while maintaining the success. The main goal is to monetize the game in a sustainable way. In the meeting, you're very impressed with the creative ideas presented. When it's your turn, near the end, you suddenly ask everyone - does it matter that our users are mostly 11-13 years old? Like many other plans, yours relies heavily on many microtransactions (many opportunities for buying in-game features for small amounts of money) and that now makes you uneasy. Your question stirred a lively discussion as some say children users require special protections while others said that microtransactions are manipulative even when users are adults. The CEO says that a core value of the company is to make products that celebrate joy and creativity rather than addiction and frustration, and tasks you to research the ethical considerations of microtransactions. In the memo you're preparing for the CEO, you consider the different issues with microtransactions in general and those that are specific to children users. In general, microtransactions are accused of being manipulative - they ‘trick' people into buying things they wouldn't want or didn't really agree to. You summarize research on the psychology of impulse purchasing and the design tricks of deception called ‘dark patterns.' You conclude that a key value is informed consent and that the company needs to decide what exactly that means. Turning to the issue of children, you find that children are particularly vulnerable to manipulations as well as claims that children under a certain age cannot at all give informed consent because their brain hasn't yet fully developed. Relatedly, you find a host of issues relating to parental control. Some apps rely on features offered by the mobile device while others involve parents' permission directly. Summarizing this section of your memo you conclude that the key question is whether, and to what extent, kids' consent is limited in its reach and specifically, what role should parents/guardians be required to play in the process of getting children's consent.Footnote:This passage presents a context where the ethical dimensions of the decision at hand were not, at first, in the forefront of the discussion. The passage digs into various ethical concerns that have been raised regarding microtransactions, sorts them into different kinds of considerations, and traces each of them to the core value that motivates them.",

A week after you settle in the res hall, you have 15 new apps on your phone. About half of them are ones you've never heard of before. One of these apps allows students in your class to post anonymous messages about whatever they want. It is supposed to be a space to ask questions and get help about mental health issues, but you quickly learn that it's where many rumors are circulated, including personal information (like who is dating who). You find it a little troubling at first, but it really starts to bother you when one student becomes a frequent target for nasty messages. She is a quiet student who doesn't engage much socially and speaks very slowly. You start hearing impatient sighs when she is called on to talk in class and it makes you feel very uncomfortable. When she incidentally appears in a Minerva Quest vlog for a few seconds, someone posts an edited version of it to the anonymous app, slowing it down to make her sound ridiculous. A string of memes then follows with other students reposting the clip with a variety of cheap photoshopped modifications that receive lots of emoji responses. Someone then writes… “you all are just assuming that she isn't on this app… but maybe it's better if she is lol.”After that, you can't take it anymore and decide you're going to respond. You hate doing this because you already have a reputation as a party pooper for complaining about noise in the study room during quiet hours. You decide you'll just have to live with it and find friends among people who really know you. You write a long message in the anonymous app and reveal your identity. You say it's not cool to make fun of someone like that and that it's not the purpose of the app. No one responds to your message, except for thumbs-up emojis, but the activity there dies out completely. You also note that people are much more careful about reacting in class when the targeted student is talking. To your face, people only express support for your post, but you also find that you aren't invited to many social events and it becomes harder to make new friends. This feels bad but you also know that this attitude will pass, and that in time, you'll find the right people for you. Plus, you're happy that the bullying stopped, at least in public.Footnote:This example reveals a case where the right thing to do was obvious but hard because it went against the grain. No one else spoke up and many people participated in the bullying so the individual knew that saying something would not be seen well by many students. They took advantage of their own moral outrage and the anger felt after seeing some of the particularly nasty messages to gather the mental fortitude needed to say something. In addition, they anticipated the consequences and prepared mentally for the result, thinking of different ways to make friends.",

He refuses to give his passwords for his laptop and cellphone, which authorities believe contain information relevant to this attack and other imminent ones. The suspect has shared videos where he threatens that other attacks are forthcoming. The government has asked the company that sells the phone and laptop to find a way to break into the phone. Still, the company is hesitant because it prides itself on prioritizing the security and privacy of its customers.On reflection, you decide to defend the position that the company should comply with the government's demands, and you draw from ethical theoretical resources to support your argument. You choose to adopt the perspective of a utilitarian, who aims to produce the greatest good for the greatest number. As a consequentialist, utilitarians would argue that the ends justify the means, and that if we have good reason to believe that violations of this one person's right to privacy could prevent catastrophic loss of life, then there would be strong ethical reasons to support policies or laws that enable a company to coordinate efforts with the government.You then pit two interpretations of utilitarianism against each other to test your argument. Utilitarians care about both long-term and short-term utility, so you develop a counterargument from another broadly utilitarian perspective that concludes the opposite – we shouldn't override personal privacy rights in this case because doing so catalyzes long-term and far-reaching opportunities for governments to claim exceptions to rules of protection for consumer privacy. Releasing private data could erode public trust and confidence in the independence of businesses from government monitoring.Then you respond to this counterargument. While there are risks in taking either approach, you reason that this is an exceptional case because of the credible and catastrophic threat to life and property this person poses. You suggest that in such a case, a company should adopt a narrowly defined exception to its privacy clause and retain judgment in future cases, which it would evaluate individually. You conclude that the company should comply with the government's demands in this case.Footnote:My defense of the ethical judgment that the company should comply with the government's request, in this case, is anchored in normative reasoning generated from utilitarian ethical principles, carefully explored by weighing two different possible utilitarian lines of reasoning. I strengthened my judgment by responding to a credible counterargument, noting specific ways to mitigate the concerns raised in the counterargument.",

During the first few weeks, you diligently plan your meals, shop for groceries, and budget time to cook while also keeping up with all your school duties. However, to your disappointment, you find that cooking in the res hall kitchen has been taking twice as long as it did cooking at home, as you always have to start by cleaning all the dishes and cooking supplies you intend to use. Worse, as the weeks go by, it becomes more frequent that cooking supplies are lost, your groceries are opened or used by other students, and you find yourself less and less excited to cook and more inclined to buy expensive SF food. Talking to an upperclass student, you hear stories about similar experiences in years past and learn that there is a whole mythology of the res hall kitchen messiness and dirtiness. “It's just the way it is,” the upperclass student tells you, “there's no point in fighting it.” You realize that just like your friend, you've come to take the kitchen messiness for granted, as an unchangeable reality. Posting a quick survey at your class's chat group quickly shows that most students would have loved it if the kitchen was cleaner and follow up by saying that “I don't clean after myself because that's what everyone else does.” Realizing that the problem is in the perceived ‘appropriate' behavior in the context of your class's social community, you gather a few friends from the cooking student initiative group and together you're organizing a campaign to encourage people to clean after themselves. You've made a catchy video to share on social media, put up signs around the kitchen, and started sharing props to specific people that you've ‘caught' cleaning after themselves. After two weeks of intensive effort, you see a significant improvement in the way the kitchen looks regularly and even note that people start asking why are you making such a big deal out of it given that the kitchen is pretty clean. You smile knowingly, noticing to yourself that they have started to take for granted the new norm you were pushing for.Footnote:A situation was analyzed to reveal that it was driven by a social norm, as people were behaving in a way they didn't prefer because they took for granted that this is the ‘way things are around here.'

The mayor sits on the table on the stage of the packed auditorium and kicks off the discussion, offering a detailed plan for a celebration of the city's 100th anniversary this year, with fireworks, musical performances, and the like. The mayor speaks for a long while until someone yells that the mayor should let others talk, which is followed by cheers of agreement from around the room. The mayor attempts to continue talking but gives up as he realizes that no one can hear him over the noise. Different citizens then take the opportunity to speak, including a well-known architect and an enthusiastic young biking advocate. The architect suggests the money should be put into earthquake preparation, citing the age of the buildings downtown and the dated set of construction regulations in the state. The bike advocate argues for improved bike lanes and traffic lights, peppering his presentation with jokes and anecdotes that the crowd seems to enjoy. At the end of the evening, there is a vote and the three proposals that get most votes are those that caught your attention. While the mayor is disappointed that his proposal only made it to the third place, you think it's quite surprising it got votes at all given the importance of other issues raised. It seems to you that the mayor had some sway over the vote given his position of authority. The success of the bike lane proposal surprises you, and you believe it did better than other more important proposals because of its advocate's charisma and humor. In the end, you are happy that the architect's expertise helped her carry the day as her proposal gets most votes.Footnote:Identifies a variety of sources of power and how they were used, including noting the shifting relevance of different sources of power in a changing situation.

You can manually assign students to rooms, but this is complicated and tedious. Worse, you would have to do it all again next year. To address this, you decided to develop an algorithm that can be automated by computer code. Firstly, the algorithm takes an input of relevant characteristics from students, including details about living preferences, habits, and interests. You decide to use drop-down menus for students to input their selections because a finite set of pre-defined inputs makes your algorithm more feasible to write compared to free-form student inputs. Based on the data and parameters, the algorithm generates a potential list of matches for each student and assigns rooms starting from the students with the least options, updating the number of available matches as rooms are being assigned. Ultimately, the algorithm generates a list of room assignments that satisfy the constraints; if it is impossible to do so, the algorithm returns a message to notify you. You implement the algorithm using a computer program, which assigns roommates effectively and efficiently and can be used for each year's room assignment given similarly-formatted data on student characteristics.

At first, it appears that you have multiple objectives to optimize, such as caloric count, protein quantity, cost, etc. Moreover, some of these objectives are in conflict with others (increasing caloric count may also increase your costs). After some deliberation, you identify cost as the objective function you wish to minimize, and frame all other values as constraints, in line with the USDA's dietary recommendations for macro and micro nutrients for your demographic group (2800-3000 cal/day, 6-8 servings of grains, 3-5 servings of vegetables, 800mg calcium, etc.). With your constraints and objective function identified, you clearly articulate your decision variable: for each item at the store, what quantity of each should be on your list? Now that your optimization problem is well formulated, you identify a computational approach to solve the problem. Given the large search space, you settle on using a genetic algorithm, which is efficient but only produces a locally optimal (and not necessarily a globally optimal) solution.

In addition to these point estimates, Mark knows to pay close attention to the “margin of error” — usually expressed as a confidence interval for each estimate. The intervals presented for the elections have a 95% confidence level. This probability refers to the reliability of constructing the interval in the frequentist perspective: if the sampling procedure were repeated many times, with different point estimates obtained for each sample and different confidence intervals formed, then we expect 95% of these intervals to contain the true approval rating for the population. Interestingly, the candidates' confidence intervals for approval rating overlapped, meaning that the standard error was large enough to suggest that there is no statistically significant difference between the ratings. He understood that while based on the poll's sample statistics, the current mayor's rating was higher, the overlapping intervals mean that the true approval ratings for each candidate in the population could actually be the other way around. Therefore, he should wait for a clearer gap before betting on one versus the other to increase the odds of winning the bet.Footnote: A population parameter, approval rating, which is the proportion of the population that approves of a candidate, is estimated using confidence intervals: the approval rate based on a sample plus/minus the margin of error.

You are working on an annual report of projects under your department, and your manager asked you to examine the relationship between projects' duration and their media coverage, quantified based on a linear formula. You calculate the correlation coefficient from the data and find an r-value of 0.48, which suggests a positive and moderately strong correlation between the variables of interest. This seems to indicate that media coverage increases linearly with project duration. However, features in the scatterplot make you hesitant about the relationship. Firstly, your boss was mainly interested in the relationship between these variables for projects with a very long duration, for which you have next to no data points. You know that while the relationship may appear somewhat linear over the given range of available data, it may be non-linear for long projects, and you should be cautious to extrapolate. Secondly, you notice substantial deviations from homoscedasticity (equal variance) which indicates there might be a more complicated relationship between the variables. For that reason, the r-value should not be taken as reliable evidence for a linear relationship, let alone a causal connection. It's possible, for example, that both have a common cause, such as the amount of funding for the project or the size of the client.Footnote:The correlation between duration and media coverage was calculated and the r-value suggested a linear relationship exists. Upon looking at the scatter plot, the reliability of the r-value was questioned due to heteroscedasticity, especially for long-duration projects which would require some extrapolation.

Plotting a histogram of the physician salaries from a database, you find that the mean is positively skewed by heart surgeons and a few other high-paying specialists. Additionally, you see that the standard deviation is large, indicating that there is substantial variation from the mean salary. You note that, while the mean is higher for physicians, you would have to be one of the few high earning physicians to earn a lot. Because of the higher median and low variance of the first mate's salary, you infer that this could actually be a safer choice: mid-level shipmates make more than mid-level physicians. In other words, in the top 50% of earners, the lowest-paid shipmates make more than the lowest-paid physicians. However, your ambition and love of medicine drive you to go for the ultimately higher earning potential of physicians, with the caveat that you will have to specialize in your discipline to achieve your desired salary (as your research shows that being a mid-level physician is not worth it, comparatively).Footnote:The mean, median, and standard deviation of the data were interpreted and analyzed to inform decision-making based on goals.

Past research shows that the shoppers at the mall have a mean weight of 55 kg and a standard deviation of 12 kg. While you don't know the shape of this underlying distribution of weights, you realize that as long as it is somewhat symmetric, you can employ the Central Limit Theorem to conclude that the sampling distribution of the sample mean (with sample size 9) is approximately normal, with a mean of 55 kg and a standard error of 4 kg (SE = SD/sqrt(n)). This allows you to accurately compute, using z-scores, the probability that the mean weight of 9 randomly selected mall shoppers is over 78 kg (700 kg / 9) as the area under the upper tail of the sampling distribution. However, you realize that perhaps the original distribution is very skewed to the left, with mostly adults at the mall but a few babies as well. In this case, since the small sample size of interest is only 9, the sampling distribution would still be skewed to the left, meaning that the probability you computed under the assumption of normality is an underestimate.

Before you panic, you start analyzing the situation. Assuming that the probability of you catching meningitis is the same as the city population, the prior probability is P(Sick) = 0.0001. The posterior probability is calculated based on the prior probability and the sensitivity and specificity of the test: P(Sick|+) = P(+|Sick)*P(Sick) / [P(+|Sick) + P(+|¬Sick)] = 0.99*0.0001 / (0.99*0.0001 + 0.01*0.9999) — which is just under 1%.

To determine how to allocate your resources, you wish to find the variables that are the strongest predictors of body mass index (BMI), a numerical measure that can indicate obesity, derived from one's height and weight. You have considerable amounts of historical data at your disposal. As a first step, you investigate how well BMI (dependent variable) can be predicted from the time spent exercising (independent variable) for your target population. You create a simple linear model and find that the coefficient of determination (R-squared), indicating the amount of variation in BMI explained by the variation in exercise, is 0.4. Thus, the predictive strength of your simple model is not so convincing, leading you to explore more variables. In addition to exercise, you extend the model to include other predictor variables, including the intake of carbohydrates, protein, and fiber. The revised model has an increased R-squared of 0.89. You also examine the regression coefficients which, for a given variable, indicate the expected change in BMI per unit change in the selected variable, holding all other predictors constant. Comparing these coefficients, you note that carbohydrate intake has by far the largest influence on BMI, with time spent exercising being second most important. Further examination of the relationships between the independent variables reveals strong multicollinearity between carbs, protein and fiber intake, leading you to realize that you can ignore the least helpful variables (protein and fiber intake) and still predict BMI with reasonable accuracy. While these findings may not indicate a causal connection, the relationships are compelling enough to help you decide how to invest your resources: provide more low-carb alternatives in school cafeterias and invest in programs involving youth fitness, physical education, and athletics.Footnote:Two regression models, one simple and one multivariate, are compared based on their explanatory power, quantified by R-squared.

The analysis shows a statistically significant difference in the average duration of a headache when using the new treatment compared to the standard treatment, reported with a standard significance level (p<0.05). This means that, assuming there is zero difference in effect, it is quite unlikely (less than 5% chance) to observe results this extreme or more. However, given the very large sample size, you know that the statistical power is high, so even small practical differences would be deemed statistically significant. Upon closely examining the size of the effect, you note that the decrease in headache duration is only 15 minutes compared to the standard treatment group. Recognizing that a typical hangover headache lasts from 5-12 hours, you become more reserved about the practical implications of the clinical trial. Your reservation is supported by the small Cohen's d value of 0.1, a standardized measure of practical significance (effect size) when comparing two means, which in this case indicates that the effect of the new treatment is small relative to the existing one.Footnote:A measure of significance was interpreted to explain the observed statistical difference considering the sample size, and statistical significance was distinguished from the practical significance of the results.",

However, bringing the equipment adds to the gas money and mental effort to take care of them. You create a decision tree with four possible outcomes: beach with kayak, beach without kayak, mountains with skis, mountains without skis. Without additional weather information, your guess is as good as a coin flip — a mere 50% accuracy. Luckily, a friend recommended a precise weather forecast app that costs $10, which predicts beach weather with 80% accuracy and mountain weather with 65% accuracy. To evaluate whether it's worth purchasing the additional information, you construct two decision trees: one with your own probabilities and one including the app's accuracies. Combining these probabilities with the utilities of each outcome allows you to compute expected utilities for both trees. Since your expected utility rises if you buy and use the app, even after incorporating its cost, you decide to buy it. Three days prior to the trip, the app predicts sunny weather at both the beach and the mountains, suggesting that kayaking at the beach is the clear winner. Note that, rather than employ maximin or maximax heuristics (something you might do without the app's information), you believe it's more rational to trust the expected utility approach. The weather turned out to be horrible, but you recognize that the highest expected utility doesn't guarantee the best outcome.Footnote:A decision tree was created to break down and map out a complex decision into a sequence of smaller, simpler decisions.

A straightforward expected value analysis reveals that they're actually expected to lose money due to the costly insurance price and the low probability for the headphones to break. You realize that your friend's utility, the satisfaction they derive from goods, is different from the expected monetary value of goods. Prospect Theory suggests various ways in which their utility is likely affected. Firstly, your friend's aversion to taking risks implies that their utility function is concave down rather than linear. Further, their aversion to loss (losing their headphones) is so strong that they would derive more dissatisfaction from a loss than they would derive satisfaction from an equivalent gain. They may also be struggling to perceive the probabilities objectively: even though there is a tiny probability of something bad happening, it's common to have a distorted view that makes one believe that losing their headphones is more likely than it really is. Considering all of these personal attitudes in the utility function and expected utility calculation reveals that the friend is indeed acting in accordance with their maximal expected utility. The friend is likely viewing this decision under a narrow frame. However, if they were to bundle this decision with other similar ones under a broad frame, their loss aversion would be diminished, and they would realize that they are losing money on average by purchasing the warranty.Footnote:The combined impacts of risk-aversion, loss-aversion, probability distortion, and narrow framing on the utility function and expected utility are considered and together help us understand the friend's decision-making behavior from an empirical perspective.

You have found a new gluten-free dough that attracts many customers, but your competitor has an amazing pizza sauce that also generates lots of business. You want to use the sauce, so you ask for the recipe in exchange for your dough recipe. After some hesitation, she says that she will send it to you. However, her hesitation leads you to think that she may not be honest about all the ingredients. In fact, you both have the same decision to make: share the correct recipe or share the incorrect recipe. You create a payoff matrix that shows the outcomes for each combination of strategies that you and your rival may employ, and predict that if both restaurants offer better pizzas, more people overall will choose to go eat pizza at the mall, thereby boosting the profits for both restaurants. However, if both parties are honest, one is always tempted to betray the other for an even higher payoff that comes from having a superior pizza that would monopolize the pizza market. So, if each of you acts in your own self-interest, you should both share incorrect recipes corresponding to the Nash equilibrium of the game. This means that when both of you adopt this strategy (being dishonest), neither shop can unilaterally change their strategy and get a higher payoff. On the other hand, your relationship with this other pizza place is likely to be on-going, and similar decisions may arise repeatedly. You realize that if either of you becomes dishonest at any point in time, the other will likely break relations too and adopt a more defensive strategy. In fear of having that happen, you choose to cooperate and find that the other shop also has this fear, and they cooperate too. You both decide to share the true recipes, believing that cooperating for the highest payoff will be more beneficial in the long run.Footnote:A game involving the two pizza stores and the exchange of correct or incorrect recipes is defined based on the scenario, and a payoff matrix examining the expected benefits for each player in each scenario is used to convince the competitor to cooperate for the greater benefit of both sides.

To gauge the state of the industry, you want to figure out how many hotels are operating in LA. You never worked in hotels, but an average establishment must have between 20 and 1000 rooms, since a small hotel could have two floors and about 10 rooms on each floor, while large chain hotels could have about 30 rooms distributed across as many floors. You reckon a regular hotel room must house between 1 and 4 visitors, as many people fly in for business trips or take vacations with their families. This means a typical hotel must house between 20 and 4,000 guests at any one time. Since you know the city has around 4 million residents, and you expect hotel guests to be proportional to that number, you assume guests number something between 5% and 10% of the population, fluctuating between seasons. In that case, there are between 200,000 and 400,000 hotel guests to fit into hotels with capacity of between 20 and 4,000. The number of hotels, then, is at least 50 and at most 20,000. These limits are separated by two orders of magnitude, so you take the approximate geometric mean of these bounds. The mean of the coefficients of each limit's scientific notation is 3.5 and their average power is 2.5. So, you round the power of 10 down to 2 and multiply the coefficient by 3. Finally, you get a grand total of 1,050 hotels in LA. After a quick Google search, you find out the reported number is 1,008. Not bad!Footnote:To arrive at a quantity of interest, related figures which are easier to estimate are used progressively, from the number of rooms and the guests they house to the total number of guests in the city. This last figure comes from a potentially problematic assumption, that the number of hotel guests is proportional to LA's population, but the final estimate is plausible nonetheless.",

You call the café to confirm, and they tell you that they do, in fact, open every Saturday, which in turn supports your premise (that either the bank or the café are open on a given day, but not both).Footnote:Available knowledge is used to construct a deductive argument in the form of a disjunctive syllogism with an exclusive or. Let P = “bank is open on Saturday” and Q = “cafe is open on Saturday”, the argument reads: (P or Q) and not (P and Q); Q; therefore, not P.

The opponent has committed a “straw man fallacy,” attacking a superficial version of the proposal and thus failing to address the proposition in question. Let X be taxation and inclusiveness, Y be socialism, and Z be bankruptcy. In simplified symbolic form, the politician claims that X → Y, that Y → Z and therefore, by hypothetical syllogism, that X → Z. While this argument is valid, it is unsound because the premises X → Y and Y → Z are not necessarily true. While it might be plausible to argue against socialism in health provision, the opponent extremified the proposition to label it ‘socialism' and refute it, a false premise that makes his argument unsound. The fallacy could have been corrected by arguing only against the specific parts of the proposal: taxation and inclusiveness.Footnote:The opponent commits a \"straw man\" fallacy, an informal fallacy of relevance, as his objection is directed towards a distorted version of the original proposition and thus fails to address the relevant question.",

When I inquired why she thought that she laid out the following reasons:Her best friend Giorgi loves Kpop.Giorgi also loves bubble tea.Her classmate Juan also likes Kpop and bubble tea.→ So all people who like Kpop also like bubble tea.This seemed like a huge generalization to me, so I tried to convince her that her conclusion might not hold. Recognizing this as an inductive generalization, I knew it would be most productive to assess its strength and reliability, so I tried to help Kate question the degree to which her conclusion is supported. First of all, the argument is not very strong since Kate only based her conclusion on two people she knows and then generalized to a large population of people. Kate can increase the strength of the argument by providing more premises to support the conclusion. She can do that by including a variety of evidence from quality sources, like surveys that have found that a majority of Kpop fans like boba or sources that provide plausible reasons/explanations for a relationship between adoration of Kpop and boba. Ensuring these premises directly support the conclusion would make her argument stronger, but it would only be consideredreliableif the pieces of evidence are actually true (e.g., from trustworthy sources) rather than just fabricated claims.  She can also strengthen the argument by making the conclusion less hasty, e.g, by saying that Most Kpop fans like bubble tea rather than all.Footnote:his application classifies Kate's reasoning as induction by generalization. The analysis of the argument assesses both the strength and reliability of the argument while clearly making a distinction between them.

Don't drive under the influence.” and the text fades in the silence.

As a popular song, people place it in context with popular culture — one that highlights partying and recreational drinking. However, placing it in such a context may lead to misinterpretation. The song is in fact about alcoholism. This is revealed by looking at the context of production: Sia has personally struggled with alcoholism in her past. Keeping authorial context in mind, and the context of the genre which is that artists often write about personal struggles in their music, a new interpretive lens is used to approach the song's analysis, and one quickly finds out that these lyrics are meant to reflect the addictive and risky nature of alcohol.Footnote:The context of the genre allows for an understanding of why the song is misunderstood (the chorus is most emphasized) as well as supports the new interpretation given about the lyrics (pop songs are often ways to share personal struggles).

Some of the author's words have slightly negative connotations, which you recognize as potentially effective in delivering the vivid thesis. Still, you note emotional language may be a sign of bias.

The sampling method was inappropriate, as it contained one small village but generalized to the whole country.

First, you choose Mathieu Ricard, known as “The Happiest Man in the World”, as a subject for a case study. You use a range of data collecting techniques, including interviews, behavioral observations, and fMRI brain scans to explore why he might exhibit such a notoriously high level of happiness. For a second case study, you choose a city in Denmark that is known for its happy citizens. You investigate a range of things about the city that might explain the happiness of its residents, such as municipal policies related to quality-of-life and the economic prosperity of the city. Both case studies reveal useful findings, but you are uncertain to what extent the findings can be generalized.

Your hypothesis is that administering three different antibiotics simultaneously is more effective than administering the same three antibiotics cyclically (one after the other), which in turn is more effective than administering only your strongest antibiotic. To address this hypothesis, you consider enlisting the help of hospitals and having doctors prescribe one of the three methods you are investigating to patients. You consider that there are two important issues with this experiment design: first, since you already have good indication that simultaneous antibiotic delivery is much better for preventing bacterial resistance, it would be unethical to deny people the best treatment. Second, it would be very hard to control relevant variables like type of bacteria, location of infection, method of antibiotic application, and others. Whereas you recognize that testing antibiotics on humans will have to be done eventually, for now you decide to run lab-based experiments on bacterial cultures, using three different antibiotics. You decide to have three intervention groups: one in which bacteria are attacked only with your strongest antibiotic during 30 days, one in which bacteria are attacked with three antibiotics for 10 days each, and one in which bacteria are attacked throughout the 30 days with all 3 antibiotics simultaneously. To account for the possibility that the injection of liquid into a bacterial culture has an effect on bacterial survival, you add a “placebo” group to the experiment, wherein a harmless liquid will be applied to bacteria. Furthermore, you add a “natural history” group of bacteria who will suffer no treatment to serve as a comparison, a baseline against the placebo and intervention groups. Finally, you are sure to control for variables like availability of sustenance, incidence of sunlight, temperature, moisture, and chemicals the bacteria are exposed to. You keep your four bacteria groups inside a sterilized lab, in petri dishes, to control for these variables. Because of the tightly controlled design of your experiment, you recognize that there may be some issues with generalizability of your results. You also consider that bacteria inhabiting living beings may react very differently to treatment, and so you suggest that, for a future experiment, you should try to kill bacteria infecting mice rather than “infecting” petri dishes. However, you are confident that the experiment can potentially reveal causal relationships.Footnote:An interventional study design is proposed in order to test the suggested hypothesis.

In another magazine, you read a summary that indicates that coffee is good for our health. You decide to look closely at both studies to see why they came to such different conclusions. The first study found a correlation between coffee drinkers and increased heart disease. This study was done with elderly working-class people in the UK. The second study found a connection between coffee drinking and decreased heart disease. This study was done with medical professionals in Denmark. You conclude that these are not necessarily contradictory, because they are not exact replications of each other. Understanding the potential confounds of using these two restricted samples, you decide to investigate the findings further by replicating the study through an interventional experiment, which would constitute a conceptual replication. You extract from these studies the hypothesis that coffee may be a contributor to heart disease, and a conceptual replication study will help you investigate this claim. You decide to run an RCT in which an intervention group drinks coffee, a placebo group drinks hot water, and a natural history group drinks none of the two (all three groups maintain all other health related habits constant). You find that, on the one hand, the increased metabolism rate due to coffee leads the intervention group to be more active and thereby perform more “cardio” exercise, improving their heart-health. At the same time, coffee seems to increase blood pressure, which poses a risk to older individuals with poor circulation. These findings may provide resolution to the discrepancy between the original studies, and they indicate that your hypothesis must be refined to accommodate the nuance. Nonetheless, because the replication was conducted in a rather homogenous population, you realize there may be problems with generalizing these results more broadly, and you decide that more studies have to be conducted in other populations.Footnote:After presenting two seemingly conflicting answers to the question “is coffee bad for your health”, a replication study is suggested to test a more specific hypothesis “is coffee bad for your heart”.

Hypothesis (b) also stems from your knowledge of genetics and the plausibility of developing resistance to particularly harmful species through genetic mutations coupled with natural selective pressures. You discuss predictions that stem from these two explanations, specifically that in case (a) most parasites would be gone, and in case (b) that the parasites might still be present in butterflies that developed resistances. Finally, you make the connection between study design, testing the mentioned predictions, and deciding which of your hypothesis is corroborated.

You enumerate the bodies that will compose your system, namely the planets and the Sun, and you incorporate the astrophysical laws that guide their movement, like Kepler's Laws. Considering relevant variables and parameters of each of your agents, like their mass, distance from the sun, and speed, you create a robust system that accounts for the gravitational interactions between planets and the sun. You set your model to represent the current time of the year and consequently the current disposition of planets, which in turn helps you identify where Jupiter will be. You cross-reference that information with what you know about your current location on the Earth to infer where Jupiter will appear in the sky. Being computer-based, your model is capable of simulating how the passage of time will affect the orbits of planets in the solar system.

Food webs are networks where the edges represent who eats whom in nature, whereas the internet is a network where edges represent webpages that link to one another. Because of this key structural similarity, the ecologists took the Google PageRank algorithm, which is an effective solution to determine the importance of webpages, and applied it to food webs. Importantly, they noted that one of the mathematical modifications Google made to account for the particular network structure of the internet could not realistically apply to food webs. They used the PageRank algorithm, but eliminated the mathematical modification and instead made a change to the network structure of food webs so that the PageRank algorithm could produce a solution of which species were most important to the health and persistence of the ecological community.

Fixing the headboard would cost way more than fixing the sofa, so it is not feasible, and you decide to keep it as a constraint to be satisfied.

The team is focusing on strategies that can appeal to supporters of the opposition party, but they are concerned that confirmation bias from those voters will lead them to overlook and devalue your Candidate's arguments. While confirmation bias is certainly a core one to identify in this situation, you suggest the team also consider how emotional bias may interact with confirmation bias to make supporters of the opposition party more resistant than they otherwise would be. The political discourse has made voters on both sides of the aisle likely to feel anger when confronted with opposition views, and you point out that anger is an emotion associated with high certainty, which will only strengthen a person's existing confirmation bias. You explain that other emotions like surprise and fear are associated with low certainty, which would affect voters' depth of thought on the issue. By identifying voters' biases in a more nuanced way, the team now has clearer direction on how to shape a successful strategy. To mitigate those biases in the campaign materials about climate change, the team decides a few things. First, potential swing voters from the opposing party will be targeted with ads that only address the ideological issues without reference to the Candidate to reduce the opportunity for confirmation bias. Further, talking points from the opposing party in support of addressing climate change will be used in the ads to capitalize on confirmation bias. If swing voters engage with those ads, then your Candidate's platform will be presented. Even though humans have caused the current climate crisis, your materials avoid that language to reduce the emotional biases that might arise from anger about hot-button issues. Instead, the materials focus on how humans can be the solution to the problem, and interesting facts like how the US is a world leader in wind energy and the surprising number of jobs that industry provides. By avoiding language known to provoke anger among the target demographic, and including information that will provoke pride and surprise, you substantially reduce the emotional bias against your Candidate's climate change policies.Footnote:The campaign strategy clearly understands the effect of confirmation bias and emotional bias on decision-making, and employs nuanced approaches to avoid and counteract the existing biases that the target demographic hold.",

While some students were in rotation cities, a large percentage were totally remote. The goal state was for all students to have opportunities to engage with their class, feel a sense of belonging, and connect their academic experience to their student life experience. The scale of the problem concerned the whole Minerva community, internationally, though considering the problem at the cohort scale also seemed useful.
