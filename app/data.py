You have access to a range of data and create a few graphs to highlight potential areas of opportunity. You wonder if there are seasonal trends, so you construct a line graph of monthly sales, which show that sales substantially dip during winter months. A line graph is appropriate because of the temporal relationship the time series data have. Next, you wonder if particular demographic groups drive sales, so you create a bar graph to compare those groups. A bar graph is appropriate because the demographic group's membership is a categorical variable. Last, you wonder if income levels may relate to product sales, so you construct a scatter plot with income levels on the x axis and product sales per customer on the y axis. A scatter plot is appropriate because the two variables are continuous variables and you want to evaluate the relationship between them. For each graph, you ensure that you have proper axis labels with units, and a brief but informative caption. The insights the data visualizations provide help guide the marketing strategy.",

Instead of a variable-led observational study that would collect data from a large sample of individuals to determine whether a variable like income relates to happiness, you decide to use the case study approach to generate hypotheses about human happiness. After you and your research associates conduct extensive literature reviews to understand what factors might influence happiness and the various ways to measure happiness, you embark on data collection. First, you choose Mathieu Ricard, known as “The Happiest Man in the World”, as a subject for a case study. You use a range of data collecting techniques, including interviews, behavioral observations, and fMRI brain scans to explore why he might exhibit such a notoriously high level of happiness. For a second case study, you choose a city in Denmark that is known for its happy citizens. You investigate a range of things about the city that might explain the happiness of its residents, such as municipal policies related to quality-of-life and the economic prosperity of the city. Both case studies reveal useful findings, but you are uncertain to what extent the findings can be generalized. You thus decide to test the hypotheses generated by your two case studies using methods from #observationalstudy, such as a prospective cohort study to corroborate how generalizable the findings are.",

You also design a comparison group where there are 3-4 activities structured into the traditional lecture. Finally, you have to decide if you should have a control group that uses the traditional lecture format. Since many articles have been published showing that active learning improves student performance in class, you decide that the control group with no active learning may disadvantage students.

Your hypothesis is that administering three different antibiotics simultaneously is more effective than administering the same three antibiotics cyclically (one after the other), which in turn is more effective than administering only your strongest antibiotic. To address this hypothesis, you consider enlisting the help of hospitals and having doctors prescribe one of the three methods you are investigating to patients. You consider that there are two important issues with this experiment design: first, since you already have good indication that simultaneous antibiotic delivery is much better for preventing bacterial resistance, it would be unethical to deny people the best treatment. Second, it would be very hard to control relevant variables like type of bacteria, location of infection, method of antibiotic application, and others. Whereas you recognize that testing antibiotics on humans will have to be done eventually, for now you decide to run lab-based experiments on bacterial cultures, using three different antibiotics. You decide to have three intervention groups: one in which bacteria are attacked only with your strongest antibiotic during 30 days, one in which bacteria are attacked with three antibiotics for 10 days each, and one in which bacteria are attacked throughout the 30 days with all 3 antibiotics simultaneously. To account for the possibility that the injection of liquid into a bacterial culture has an effect on bacterial survival, you add a “placebo” group to the experiment, wherein a harmless liquid will be applied to bacteria. Furthermore, you add a “natural history” group of bacteria who will suffer no treatment to serve as a comparison, a baseline against the placebo and intervention groups. Finally, you are sure to control for variables like availability of sustenance, incidence of sunlight, temperature, moisture, and chemicals the bacteria are exposed to. You keep your four bacteria groups inside a sterilized lab, in petri dishes, to control for these variables. Because of the tightly controlled design of your experiment, you recognize that there may be some issues with generalizability of your results. You also consider that bacteria inhabiting living beings may react very differently to treatment, and so you suggest that, for a future experiment, you should try to kill bacteria infecting mice rather than “infecting” petri dishes. However, you are confident that the experiment can potentially reveal causal relationships.",

You ask to have the questions separated on the survey so that the problem can be diagnosed more accurately. You further decide to add an open-ended question, “What (if anything) makes you most uncomfortable about our seats?”, to gain qualitative input of what you might want to change as well.

Your coworker conducted the survey again this year with these same schools. Based on this new survey, your co-worker concludes that average awareness of climate issues has drastically improved on a national level. You inform your co-worker that this sample may no longer be representative of the larger population because these students were exposed to the survey questions from the previous year, which might have increased their awareness of climate change relative to the target population. You suggest keeping the stratification by states but randomly sampling new schools from each state and repeating the process.

In another magazine, you read a summary that indicates that coffee is good for our health. You decide to look closely at both studies to see why they came to such different conclusions. The first study found a correlation between coffee drinkers and increased heart disease. This study was done with elderly working-class people in the UK. The second study found a connection between coffee drinking and decreased heart disease. This study was done with medical professionals in Denmark. You conclude that these are not necessarily contradictory, because they are not exact replications of each other. Understanding the potential confounds of using these two restricted samples, you decide to investigate the findings further by replicating the study through an interventional experiment, which would constitute a conceptual replication. You extract from these studies the hypothesis that coffee may be a contributor to heart disease, and a conceptual replication study will help you investigate this claim. You decide to run an RCT in which an intervention group drinks coffee, a placebo group drinks hot water, and a natural history group drinks none of the two (all three groups maintain all other health related habits constant). You find that, on the one hand, the increased metabolism rate due to coffee leads the intervention group to be more active and thereby perform more “cardio” exercise, improving their heart-health. At the same time, coffee seems to increase blood pressure, which poses a risk to older individuals with poor circulation. These findings may provide resolution to the discrepancy between the original studies, and they indicate that your hypothesis must be refined to accommodate the nuance. Nonetheless, because the replication was conducted in a rather homogenous population, you realize there may be problems with generalizing these results more broadly, and you decide that more studies have to be conducted in other populations.",

Hypothesis (b) also stems from your knowledge of genetics and the plausibility of developing resistance to particularly harmful species through genetic mutations coupled with natural selective pressures. You discuss predictions that stem from these two explanations, specifically that in case (a) most parasites would be gone, and in case (b) that the parasites might still be present in butterflies that developed resistances. Finally, you make the connection between study design, testing the mentioned predictions, and deciding which of your hypothesis is corroborated.

Considering relevant variables and parameters of each of your agents, like their mass, distance from the sun, and speed, you create a robust system that accounts for the gravitational interactions between planets and the sun. You set your model to represent the current time of the year and consequently the current disposition of planets, which in turn helps you identify where Jupiter will be. You cross-reference that information with what you know about your current location on the Earth to infer where Jupiter will appear in the sky.

Food webs are networks where the edges represent who eats whom in nature, whereas the internet is a network where edges represent webpages that link to one another. Because of this key structural similarity, the ecologists took the Google PageRank algorithm, which is an effective solution to determine the importance of webpages, and applied it to food webs. Importantly, they noted that one of the mathematical modifications Google made to account for the particular network structure of the internet could not realistically apply to food webs. They used the PageRank algorithm, but eliminated the mathematical modification and instead made a change to the network structure of food webs so that the PageRank algorithm could produce a solution of which species were most important to the health and persistence of the ecological community.

While confirmation bias is certainly a core one to identify in this situation, you suggest the team also consider how emotional bias may interact with confirmation bias to make supporters of the opposition party more resistant than they otherwise would be. The political discourse has made voters on both sides of the aisle likely to feel anger when confronted with opposition views, and you point out that anger is an emotion associated with high certainty, which will only strengthen a person’s existing confirmation bias.

You suggest employing more door-to-door campaigning will increase support among residents because they seek more face-to-face interactions. Your colleague argues that while your proposal makes sense, you don't have the means to determine the impact of door-to-door visits. Your colleague is suggesting that your hypothesis that increasing face-to-face interactions will cause an increase in support among residents is untestable. First, you suggest randomizing the intervention (door-to-door campaigning) among the city’s neighborhoods. Then, you inform the other campaign channels to keep the same strategy over the research period. You predict that there will be a larger increase in support among residents in the neighborhoods that received the door-to-door intervention compared to the other campaign channels (control groups). While your hypothesis is testable in principle, however, you still need to find out whether it is testable in practice. You ask your manager how much budget you would be able to allot for this experiment and they give you a sufficient amount to cover all expenses. You then investigate how long your experiment would take and realize you would need to have the results done by the end of the campaign. Since the entire research project would take around 2 months, and the elections are in 4 months time, your hypothesis is determined to be testable in both principle and practice. To improve the testability of the hypothesis even more, you generate a second prediction: that polling numbers will increase significantly in the neighborhoods with door-to-door campaigning compared to the neighborhoods without. Both of these predictions are useful while testing your hypothesis.",
