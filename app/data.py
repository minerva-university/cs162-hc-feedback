        "general_example": "You are struck by the number of homeless people you see on the streets of San Francisco and decide to investigate further and write an article in an undergraduate journal. While you may feel outraged by the poor social and economic support you find in the city for this population, you realize that you need to do more than express your outrage in your article. You must present a clear and specific claim about conditions contributing to this problem. As such, you end the introduction of your essay with a clear, arguable, and precise thesis based on your findings: Investing in homeless shelters is merely a temporary relief to homelessness in San Francisco because doing so fails to address underlying causes in terms of housing unaffordability, low wages, and rising inflation.",
        "footnote": "The thesis lays out precisely what the paper will argue, provides a clear indication of the significant reasons you'll offer in support of that argument, and explains the relevance of your argument. The statement is arguable, precise, and clear.",

        "hc_name": "argument",
        "general_example": "When discussing the impact of social media on modern communication, it's essential to consider both the positive and negative aspects. For instance, while social media platforms enable instant communication and the sharing of ideas, they also contribute to the spread of misinformation and the erosion of face-to-face interactions. Therefore, a balanced argument must address these dual facets to provide a comprehensive view.",
        "footnote": "This example demonstrates clear cause-effect relationships and the importance of addressing multiple perspectives in an argument. It highlights the need for a balanced approach when discussing complex issues.",
